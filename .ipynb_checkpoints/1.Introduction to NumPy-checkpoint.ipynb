    "One of the reasons that the Python language is extremely popular is that it makes writing programs easy. Because Python is a high-level language, we don't have to worry about things like allocating memory on our computer or choosing how certain operations are done by our computer's processor. In contrast, when we use low-level languages like C, we define exactly how memory will be managed and how the processor will execute our instructions. This means that coding in a low-level language takes longer; however, we have more ability to optimize our code to run faster."
